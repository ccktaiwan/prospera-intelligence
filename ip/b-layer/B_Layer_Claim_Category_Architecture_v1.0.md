Purpose
This document defines the platform-level claim category architecture for the underlying intellectual property (B Layer) of Prospera Intelligence. It does not contain legal claim language. Instead, it establishes the strategic structure from which patent claims may be drafted.
Claim Category 1 – Governance Boundary Definition
The system operates under predefined governance boundaries that cannot be altered by the system itself.
These boundaries apply prior to any decision-making, learning, or autonomous behavior.
Executable anchors include authority partitioning, immutable rule constraints, and pre-execution boundary validation.
Claim Category 2 – Decision Authority Separation
Decision authority, execution authority, and supervisory authority are structurally separated.
At least one authority layer remains under human or external governance control.
Executable anchors include escalation mechanisms, human-in-the-loop enforcement, and authority validation modules.
Claim Category 3 – Governance-First Execution Constraint
All system actions are subject to governance validation before execution.
Governance is embedded as a system condition, not an external policy layer.
Executable anchors include pre-execution checks, enforcement kernels, and execution gating logic.
Claim Category 4 – System Evolution Constraint
System evolution occurs only within predefined governance boundaries.
Structural changes cannot override or redefine core governance principles.
Executable anchors include versioned evolution control, constrained parameter adjustment, and human-approved structural modification.
Claim Category 5 – Human-Centric Override
The system includes irreversible mechanisms for human final intervention.
Automated processes cannot deny or bypass human override authority.
Executable anchors include override interfaces, kill switches, and exception authority control.
Claim Category 6 – Cross-Technology Applicability
The governance architecture applies across different technological implementations.
The system remains valid independent of specific AI models or execution technologies.
Executable anchors include abstraction layers and modular governance interfaces.
Claim Category 7 – System Integrity Preservation
System integrity mechanisms ensure governance consistency during deployment, scaling, or integration.
Expansion cannot weaken or bypass existing governance structures.
Executable anchors include integrity verification, compliance validation, and deployment constraints.
